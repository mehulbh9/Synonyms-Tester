# Synonyms-Tester
synonyms.py is a group project together made by Dav Vrat Chadha and Mehul Bhardwaj.
This goal of this program is to calculate word similarities between a given word and three other words, and return a score of similarity (synonym score) for an entire list.
For this, the program uses two long pieces of literature, Swann's Way by Marcel Proust (sw.txt), and War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy (wp.txt), to create semantic descriptors, by listing each word in the texts with all other words used in the same sentence to get a context of where a particular word is used. To check the similarity between given words, euclidean norm and cosine similarity function are used for this program. These functions return a value based upon the similarity between words, using the semantic descriptors to check it. This is repeated for all words given in the retest.txt file. And a final similarity score for the entire file is returned by the program.

Note: the order of word in retest.txt is important because the first word represents the test case and the next three words in the same line are the three words with which the similarity is supposed to be checked. For instance, in line 1, "draw paint walk paint", 'draw' is the test word whose similarity is to checked with 'paint, walk, and paint' to find if these three words are synonyms of 'draw'.
